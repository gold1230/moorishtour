Leave the city and travel northeast through countryside, small towns and agricultural landscapes toward Ouzoud Waterfalls, one of Morocco's best-known natural attractions. After arrival, follow walking paths and viewpoints around the falls, where the cascades drop into a green valley surrounded by olive trees and rocky cliffs. Depending on your pace, walk toward the lower viewpoints, enjoy lunch overlooking the valley and take time for photography. This first day focuses on nature rather than a long desert transfer, giving you a relaxed introduction to Morocco outside Marrakech. Spend the night in the Ouzoud area.",

        "This sample review is written for the 7-day Morocco itinerary from Marrakech. We loved starting with Ouzoud Waterfalls because it made the trip feel different from a normal desert tour. The mountain villages, Dades Valley and Todra Gorge were beautiful, and the full day in Merzouga gave us time for Khamlia, a cooking experience, camel trekking and the desert camp. Ait Ben Haddou and the High Atlas were a perfect way to return to Marrakech.",

        "This sample testimonial reflects the variety of this seven-day route. Ouzoud was peaceful and green, while the road through the Demnate region and traditional villages gave us a more local side of Morocco. Merzouga was the highlight, especially the camel trek at sunset and the luxury desert camp. We also enjoyed Todra Gorge, Ouarzazate and exploring Ait Ben Haddou before crossing the Atlas Mountains.",

        "This sample review is tailored to the exact Marrakech round-trip itinerary. The mix of waterfalls, mountain scenery, old villages, Sahara dunes and historic kasbahs made every day feel different. The cooking class in Merzouga was a fun cultural experience, and sleeping in the desert camp under the stars was unforgettable. The guided time in Marrakech at the end was also a nice way to finish the week.",
