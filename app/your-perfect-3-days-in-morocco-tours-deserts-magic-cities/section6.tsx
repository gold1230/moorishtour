        , expecting to spend most of their time around the medina, souks and
        historic attractions. But once they begin looking beyond the city,
        the Sahara often becomes one of the experiences they most want to
        include.

        This journey connects the vibrant atmosphere of{" "}

      <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
        What makes the tour especially interesting is the variety travelers

        , passes traditional villages, reaches historic kasbahs, continues
        through valleys and rocky landscapes, and finally arrives beside

        The scenery changes repeatedly throughout the journey, which keeps
        the road interesting. Mountain landscapes can give way to valleys,
        palm groves, dry plateaus and eventually the open Sahara. Instead of
        experiencing only one destination, travelers see several very
        different sides of Morocco.

          is that it makes a Sahara experience possible within a relatively

          to reach the desert and experience the famous dunes around
          Merzouga.

          Travelers can then experience camel trekking across the dunes,
          usually around the late afternoon or sunset depending on the
          itinerary and conditions. The pace becomes slower, city noise
          disappears and the open desert landscape becomes the main focus.

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Around sunset, the changing light creates warm colors across the

          The following morning, sunrise over the dunes provides another
          completely different view of the Sahara. This combination of
          camel trekking, desert sunset, camp atmosphere and sunrise is what
          gives a short itinerary a genuine desert feeling.
