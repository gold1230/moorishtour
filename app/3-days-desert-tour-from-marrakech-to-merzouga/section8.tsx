        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          For international visitors, clear planning is particularly useful

          Travelers who prefer English communication should confirm the
          language spoken by their driver or guide when booking. Available
          vehicle type, group size, accommodation level and desert camp
          facilities should also be confirmed in advance because these can
          vary according to the selected package.
