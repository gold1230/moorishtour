    On the second day, discover more of Marrakech&apos;s culture and history.
    You can visit historic neighborhoods, traditional architecture and famous
    places around the medina while learning more about the story of the Red
    City. A guided visit is a good option if you want to understand the history
    behind the streets, buildings and local traditions.

    <br />
    <br />

    The third day gives you a chance to leave Marrakech and see another side of
    Morocco. You can choose a nature trip to{" "}
    <PlaceHoverCard place="ouzoud-waterfalls">
      Ouzoud Waterfalls
