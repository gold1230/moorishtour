Leave Morocco's Atlantic side and travel inland toward Meknes, one of the country's historic imperial cities. Depending on your starting city and departure time, enjoy a short stop in Meknes for sightseeing, coffee or lunch before continuing southeast. As the road moves farther from the coast, the scenery changes from urban and agricultural landscapes to rolling hills and mountain views. Continue toward Midelt, a town located between the Middle Atlas and High Atlas regions and a useful overnight point on the road to southeastern Morocco. Arrive in Midelt in the afternoon or evening, check into your hotel or guesthouse and relax before the next day's journey through the Ziz Valley toward the Sahara.",

In the late afternoon, meet your camel guide and begin a peaceful camel trek across the Sahara as the sun moves lower over the dunes. Stop to enjoy sunset before continuing to your desert camp.

At Todra Gorge, take time for a walk between the high limestone canyon walls and enjoy the cooler air beside the riverbed before continuing north. The route then climbs away from the desert-edge valleys toward the High Atlas region of Imilchil. The scenery changes noticeably as dry plateaus give way to mountain landscapes, traditional villages and higher elevations.

        "This sample review is written for the 4-day Casablanca or Rabat to Sahara Desert route. The journey through Meknes and Midelt was a great introduction to inland Morocco, and the Ziz Valley was one of the most scenic parts of the drive. Reaching Merzouga for the camel trek, sunset over Erg Chebbi and the overnight desert camp made the Sahara experience unforgettable. Todra Gorge and the mountain road toward Imilchil added a very different landscape before the return through Kasbah Tadla.",

        "This sample testimonial is tailored to the Casablanca and Rabat departure version of the tour. The route was varied, with Meknes, Midelt, the palm groves of the Ziz Valley, Erfoud and the Sahara all in four days. The camel ride across Erg Chebbi at sunset was the highlight, while the stop at Todra Gorge and the overnight stay in Imilchil made the return journey feel much more interesting than simply driving back the same way.",

The changing landscapes were the best part, from the imperial-city atmosphere of Meknes to Midelt, the oasis scenery of the Ziz Valley, the Sahara dunes near Merzouga and the high mountain region around Imilchil. The camel trek at sunset and the desert camp were special, and the final route through Kasbah Tadla completed a very varied Morocco road trip.",

    },
    {
      question:
        "Is 4 days enough to visit the Sahara from Casablanca or Rabat?",

      answer:
        "Four days is possible and gives you more flexibility than a three-day Sahara trip. The route still includes long road sections, but the overnight stops in Midelt, Merzouga and Imilchil divide the journey into more manageable stages.",

      question:
        "Does the tour stop in Meknes?",

      answer:
        "Yes. Meknes is included on the first day's route. The amount of sightseeing time depends on your pickup city, departure time and overall driving schedule.",

    {
      question:
        "Where do we stay on the first night?",

      question:

    },
    {
      question:
        "Is camel trekking included in Merzouga?",

      answer:
        "Yes. The standard itinerary includes a camel trek across the Erg Chebbi dunes, normally timed around sunset before reaching the desert camp.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Can I reach the Sahara camp without riding a camel?",

    },
    {
      question:
        "Why is Imilchil included in the itinerary?",
