We loved how much variety the trip included, from Casablanca and Rabat to blue Chefchaouen, Volubilis and the medina of Fes. The journey through the Middle Atlas to Merzouga was beautiful, and the camel trek, Sahara sunset and desert camp were unforgettable. Todra Gorge, Dades Valley, Ait Ben Haddou and the final Essaouira day trip made the itinerary feel complete.",

The Sahara camp under the stars was a highlight, but Ait Ben Haddou, the High Atlas and the guided Marrakech visit were equally memorable.",
