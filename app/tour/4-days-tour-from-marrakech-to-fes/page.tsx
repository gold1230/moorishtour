Leave the busy streets of the Red City and begin the scenic drive across the High Atlas Mountains. The road climbs through changing mountain landscapes, traditional Amazigh villages and wide viewpoints where you can stop for photographs and short breaks. Continue toward Ait Ben Haddou, one of Morocco's best-known fortified ksars and an important example of traditional earthen architecture. Take time to walk through the old settlement, explore its narrow passages and climb to a higher viewpoint overlooking the surrounding valley. After the visit, continue to Ouarzazate, a southern Moroccan city known for kasbah landscapes and its long connection with international film productions. Depending on timing, enjoy a short city stop or visit the exterior of a kasbah before checking into your hotel or guesthouse. Dinner and overnight in Ouarzazate.",

The journey passes kasbah landscapes, palm groves and traditional villages as you move toward the Skoura region and the road often associated with Morocco's many old kasbahs. Continue through Rose Valley and Kelaat M'Gouna, an area known for rose cultivation, local cooperatives and rural valley scenery. During spring, the region becomes especially colorful, but the landscapes remain attractive throughout the year. From Kelaat M'Gouna, travel deeper into the Dades Valley, where the road follows dramatic rock formations, old mud-brick villages and mountain scenery. Stop at panoramic viewpoints and, when time allows, take short walks to enjoy the valley from different angles. Arrive at your hotel or guesthouse in the Dades region in the late afternoon.

From Tinghir, travel to Todra Gorge, where high limestone walls create one of the most impressive canyon landscapes in southern Morocco.

The route crosses dry plateaus, oasis areas and small desert towns before passing the wider Erfoud and Tafilalet region. Later in the afternoon, arrive in Merzouga, the desert village beside the golden dunes of Erg Chebbi. Meet your camel guide and begin a camel trek across the Sahara while the evening light changes the colors of the dunes. Stop to enjoy sunset, then continue toward your desert camp.

After breakfast at the camp, return toward Merzouga by camel or 4x4 according to your arrangement and meet your driver for the final journey to Fes. Leave the Sahara behind and travel through the Ziz region, stopping at a panoramic viewpoint over the long palm-filled Ziz Valley. Continue north through changing landscapes toward Midelt, where you can stop for lunch or a rest break. The road then climbs into the Middle Atlas, replacing dry desert scenery with cooler mountain landscapes, forests and high plateaus. Continue through Ifrane, known for its mountain setting and distinctive architecture, before driving toward Fes. Arrive in Fes in the evening for drop-off at your riad, hotel or another agreed location.

        "This sample review is written for the 4-day Marrakech to Fes desert route. Crossing the High Atlas and visiting Ait Ben Haddou was a great start, while Dades Valley and Todra Gorge showed a completely different landscape. The camel trek into Erg Chebbi at sunset and the desert camp were unforgettable. The final drive through Ziz Valley, Midelt and the Middle Atlas to Fes made the journey feel like a real crossing of Morocco.",

    {
      question:
        "What is the route for the 4 days tour from Marrakech to Fes?",

      answer:
        "The route travels from Marrakech across the High Atlas to Ait Ben Haddou and Ouarzazate, continues through Rose Valley and Dades Valley, reaches Merzouga through Todra Gorge, then finishes in Fes via Ziz Valley, Midelt, the Middle Atlas and Ifrane.",
    },

    {
      question:
        "Is 4 days enough for a Marrakech to Fes desert tour?",

      answer:
        "Four days is a practical length for travelers who want to connect Marrakech and Fes through the Sahara. It still includes long road sections, but the additional day gives more time for southern Morocco than many three-day Marrakech to Fes routes.",

    {
      question:
        "Why choose a 4-day Marrakech to Fes tour instead of a 3-day tour?",

      answer:
        "The four-day version can divide the southern route more comfortably, giving you more time around Ouarzazate, Rose Valley and Dades before reaching Merzouga.",
    },

    {
      question:
        "Does the tour visit Ait Ben Haddou?",

      answer:

    },

    {
      question:
        "Do we stay overnight in Dades Valley?",

        "Yes. The second night is in the Dades region, giving you time to enjoy valley scenery before continuing to Todra Gorge and Merzouga.",
    },

    {
      question:
        "Is Todra Gorge included?",

      answer:
        "Yes. Day three includes a walking stop in Todra Gorge before continuing toward the Sahara.",
    },

    {
      question:
