            3-day desert tour from Marrakech to Merzouga

          feels so cinematic is the speed at which the scenery changes. A
          single route moves through city streets, mountain passes, historic
          architecture, green valleys, rocky desert plains and finally huge
          golden dunes.

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">

          <PlaceHoverCard place="marrakech">Marrakech</PlaceHoverCard>{" "}
          before moving toward the High Atlas Mountains. During winter,
          higher mountain peaks can sometimes carry snow, creating another

          adds to this cinematic feeling. Its fortified buildings and

          television productions for many years.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Walking through the ksar gives travelers the feeling of entering a
          historic setting, especially when looking across the surrounding
          valleys from higher parts of the settlement.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">

          . Around sunset, the sand can shift from bright gold to warm
          orange tones while long shadows move across the dunes.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Camel trekking during this time adds another classic Sahara scene.
          The caravan moves slowly across the dunes while the sun lowers
          toward the horizon, creating a completely different atmosphere
          from the road journey earlier in the day.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          After dark, the desert camp creates yet another setting. Depending
          on the camp and package, travelers may enjoy dinner and traditional
          music before spending time outside beneath the night sky.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Away from strong urban lighting and when weather conditions are
          clear, the desert sky can provide excellent views of the stars.
          The combination of open space, dunes and quiet surroundings creates
          a memorable final scene for the second day of the journey.
