After arrival, walk along viewpoints and paths around the falls, enjoy the green valley scenery and take time for photographs. Depending on your pace, continue toward lower viewpoints and enjoy lunch near the water.

Continue through traditional villages and quiet mountain roads where local houses, farms and valleys show a more rural side of Morocco. Later, travel toward southern Morocco and the Dades Valley. As you approach the valley, the scenery changes to dry mountains, old kasbahs and unusual rock formations. Arrive in Dades in the evening for dinner and overnight.",

Starting with Ouzoud Waterfalls was a beautiful way to begin, and the road through Demnate and the village areas showed us a quieter side of Morocco. Dades and Todra were impressive, but the camel trek in Erg Chebbi and the luxury desert camp were unforgettable. Ait Ben Haddou and the final Marrakech medina day completed the trip perfectly.",
