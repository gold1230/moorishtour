Leave the city and travel south through the Ziz region, one of southeastern Morocco's most distinctive oasis landscapes. Stop at panoramic viewpoints overlooking the long palm groves of the Ziz Valley, where green date palms contrast with dry mountains and rocky desert terrain. Continue toward Erfoud and the Tafilalet region before reaching Merzouga, the desert village beside the golden Erg Chebbi dunes. Depending on your arrival time, settle into your hotel or desert-side accommodation and enjoy a relaxed first evening near the Sahara. This first day is designed as a smooth introduction to the region, combining arrival, oasis scenery and the first view of the dunes.",

Travel around Erg Chebbi by 4x4 and discover the changing scenery between golden dunes, black desert, small settlements and open Sahara landscapes. Visit Khamlia, a village known for its connection with Gnawa musical traditions, and enjoy time learning about the local cultural heritage. Depending on the confirmed route and local conditions, the excursion can continue into desert areas where nomadic or semi-nomadic families live. Any such visit should be respectful and based on genuine local arrangements rather than treated as a staged attraction. Later in the afternoon, return to the edge of Erg Chebbi and meet your camel guide. Ride across the dunes around sunset, then continue to the Sahara camp for dinner, local music and an overnight stay under the desert sky.",

Continue to Rissani, an important historic town in the Tafilalet region. When the traditional market is operating, enjoy time to experience its local atmosphere, produce stalls, spices and regional trade. After Rissani, travel west across dry plateaus and oasis landscapes toward Tinghir. The palm-filled oasis of Tinghir marks the entrance to Todra Gorge, where high limestone walls rise dramatically on both sides of the canyon. Take a short walk through the gorge, enjoy the cooler air and mountain scenery, then check into your hotel or guesthouse in the Todra area for dinner and overnight.",

Follow scenic roads and panoramic routes through valleys, mountain foothills and traditional communities. The area is connected with Ait Atta Amazigh heritage, and the day can include stops in villages where daily life, agriculture and local architecture are still closely linked to the landscape. The exact route may change with road conditions, season and the final tour plan, but the focus is on rural scenery, quiet roads and a more local side of southern Morocco. Enjoy panoramic viewpoints over the valley, short walks and time for photography before returning to the Dades region for another overnight stay.",

The road gradually reconnects with the Ziz Valley, giving you another opportunity to enjoy its palm groves and dramatic dry scenery from a different direction. Stop for lunch, coffee or photos depending on timing before continuing to Errachidia. Arrive in the afternoon or evening for drop-off at your hotel, Errachidia Airport or another agreed location.

The full desert excursion, Khamlia, the camel trek and the night in the camp were highlights. We also really enjoyed Rissani, Todra Gorge and the slower days around Dades Valley.",

The camel trek at sunset, sunrise over Erg Chebbi and the desert camp were unforgettable, but the journey became even more interesting after Merzouga. The drive through Tinghir, Todra Gorge and Dades Valley was scenic, and visiting rural Ait Atta areas gave the trip a more local feeling.",

      question:
        "Is Errachidia a good starting point for a Merzouga desert tour?",

    {
      question:
        "What places are included in this 6-day Errachidia itinerary?",

      question:
        "Is Khamlia included?",

        "Do we visit nomadic families?",

      answer:
        "A respectful visit in desert areas where nomadic or semi-nomadic families live may be included depending on local conditions and the confirmed route. It should not be treated as a guaranteed staged attraction.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Is camel trekking included in Merzouga?",

    {
      question:
        "Can I reach the desert camp by 4x4 instead of camel?",

      question:
        "Does the tour visit Rissani market?",

                    southeastern Morocco instead of using several days just to
                    reach the Sahara. Starting in Errachidia gives you quick

                  <p>
                    The itinerary combines a full Merzouga desert excursion
                    with slower exploration around Dades Valley, making it a
                    strong choice for travelers who want both Sahara experiences
                    and rural southern Morocco.
