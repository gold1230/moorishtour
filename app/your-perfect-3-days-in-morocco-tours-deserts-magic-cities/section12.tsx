        is where you sleep and relax after the long scenic drives through
        southern Morocco. Comfortable accommodation gives you time to rest
        between the mountain journey, sightseeing stops and the Sahara
        experience.

        Accommodation is therefore more than simply a place to sleep. It
        becomes part of the journey itself, combining Moroccan design,
        traditional food, desert atmosphere and time to relax before the
        next part of the itinerary.

          Standard camps generally focus on a simpler desert atmosphere.
          Tents normally provide beds, bedding and blankets, while bathroom

          Some camps provide larger beds, private bathrooms, showers and more

          lounge areas. It is always useful to check photographs and the
          exact list of facilities before confirming your booking.

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          This option can be especially attractive for couples, honeymoon

            3 days desert tour from Marrakech to Merzouga
          </strong>{" "}
          is whether they can have a private bathroom and shower during the
          Sahara night.
        </p>

          Higher-comfort camps around{" "}

          may offer private en-suite tents with their own toilet, sink and
          shower. Hot water availability and bathroom design depend on the
          specific camp.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Having a private bathroom can be particularly useful for couples,
          families and travelers who prefer more privacy after camel
          trekking and time outside in the desert.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Higher-comfort tents may also include larger beds, thicker
          blankets, additional floor space and room for luggage. During
          cooler desert nights, good bedding can make the overnight stay
          noticeably more comfortable.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Because facilities differ between camps, travelers should not
          assume that every &quot;luxury desert camp&quot; includes exactly
          the same amenities. If a private bathroom, hot shower or specific
          bed arrangement is important to you, confirm it before booking.
