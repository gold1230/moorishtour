Travel through the High Atlas Mountains, passing mountain villages and stopping to enjoy the views from the Tizi n'Tichka route. At Ait Ben Haddou, discover the old earthen kasbah and its narrow paths, a famous stop for travelers crossing southern Morocco. Continue through Ouarzazate, the Skoura area and the Valley of Roses as the scenery changes from mountain peaks to rocky valleys and palm groves. Arrive in the Dades Valley for dinner and your first night in a hotel or riad. This first day is full of beautiful scenery, so expect time on the road as well as stops for photos and sightseeing.",

Pass through Erfoud, known for its fossil workshops and nearby date-palm oases, and continue toward Merzouga. The golden dunes of Erg Chebbi appear as you get closer to the village. In the afternoon, meet your local camel guide for a ride on the sand dunes, with time to enjoy the desert colors at sunset. Reach your Sahara camp for a Moroccan dinner and a quiet evening under the stars. A 4x4 camp transfer may be arranged for guests who prefer not to ride a camel.",

There will be breaks during the journey, depending on the day's road conditions and timing.

            <Overview highlightsOverview={highlightsOverview}>
              The journey begins in lively Marrakech and takes you across the Atlas Mountains, where the scenery changes from green mountain villages to dry rocky landscapes. Over three days, discover the historic Ait Ben Haddou kasbah, the Dades Valley and Todra Gorge before reaching Merzouga. Here you can enjoy a camel trek, sunset over the dunes and a night in a traditional-style desert camp. The return trip to Marrakech is long but gives you another chance to see Morocco&apos;s mountain and desert views. This itinerary is well suited to travelers who want a short Sahara experience while still visiting the main places along the route.
