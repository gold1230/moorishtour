        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          For many travelers, riding slowly across the sand while the sun
          moves lower over the Sahara is one of the images they imagined
          before visiting Morocco. The camel trek gives you time to leave the
          road behind and experience the dunes at a much slower pace.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          After arriving near{" "}
          <PlaceHoverCard place="merzouga">Merzouga</PlaceHoverCard>
          , the camel caravan normally begins in the later afternoon,
          depending on the season, weather and sunset time.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          As the caravan moves farther into the dunes, the colors of the sand
          gradually change. Bright golden tones can become warmer orange and
          red shades as the sun moves closer to the horizon.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          The experience is not only about taking photographs. The slower
          movement through the dunes gives travelers time to enjoy the open
          landscape and the quieter atmosphere of the Sahara.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          The exact duration of the camel trek varies by camp and itinerary,
          so travelers should confirm this before departure. Anyone with
          mobility, back or other physical concerns should also discuss the
          camel ride in advance so an appropriate alternative can be
          arranged when possible.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">

          Sandboarding Experience in Erg Chebbi
        </h3>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Travelers looking for an additional activity can sometimes try
          sandboarding during the{" "}
          <strong className="font-semibold text-slate-900">
            3 days desert tour from Marrakech to Merzouga
          </strong>
          . The soft dunes around Erg Chebbi create a natural setting for
          sliding down the sand.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Some{" "}
          <PlaceHoverCard place="merzouga">Merzouga desert camps</PlaceHoverCard>{" "}
          provide boards for guests, while other tours may offer
          sandboarding only as an optional activity. If this experience is
          important to you, confirm availability before booking.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Sandboarding is relatively simple to try. Travelers climb a dune,
          position themselves on the board and slide down the sandy slope.
          Beginners can usually start on smaller dunes before trying a
          steeper section.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          The climb back to the top can actually be the hardest part because
          walking uphill through soft sand requires more effort than walking
          on a normal path.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Cooler periods of the day, such as late afternoon or early morning,
          are generally more comfortable for active experiences in the dunes,
          particularly during warmer seasons.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
          Sandboarding gives travelers another way to experience{" "}

          instead of simply looking at the dunes from a distance.

          Away from the stronger artificial lighting found in large cities,
