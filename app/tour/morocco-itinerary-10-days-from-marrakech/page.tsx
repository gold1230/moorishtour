        "What is the desert cooking experience on day six?",

      answer:
        "The exact activity depends on the final booking, but it can involve learning about simple Moroccan food preparation and ingredients used in the desert region. Confirm the format and whether it is included before booking.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Does the tour visit Todra Gorge and Dades Valley?",

      answer:
        "Yes. Day seven includes the Tinghir area, Todra Gorge, Dades Valley and Rose Valley, giving travelers a full day of canyon, oasis and mountain scenery.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Are Ouzoud Waterfalls included?",

      answer:
        "Yes. Instead of returning directly to Marrakech from the south, the itinerary continues toward Ouzoud Waterfalls for an overnight stay and morning visit before returning to Marrakech on day nine.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Is this Morocco itinerary private?",

      answer:
        "The page is designed as a private tour, which allows more flexibility with departure times, photo stops, accommodation categories and the pace of the journey.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What accommodation is used during the 10-day tour?",

      answer:
        "Accommodation can include riads, hotels, mountain guesthouses and a Sahara desert camp. Exact properties and room categories depend on the package you choose and availability for your dates.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Are all meals included?",

      answer:
        "No. Breakfasts are normally included with accommodation, and dinners are commonly included in selected mountain, desert and southern stays. Lunches, drinks and meals not listed in the final booking remain separate.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How much driving is involved?",

      answer:
        "This is a road-based Morocco itinerary covering several regions, so some days include long drives. The route is divided with sightseeing stops and overnight stays to make the journey more interesting and manageable.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Is this itinerary suitable for families?",

      answer:
        "Families can enjoy the itinerary, especially on a private tour, but parents should consider the ages of their children and the longer driving days. Additional rest stops and a slower schedule can be arranged when possible.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What should I pack for this 10-day Morocco tour?",

      answer:
        "Bring comfortable walking shoes, light clothing, sun protection, a warm layer for mountains and desert nights, personal medication, a reusable water bottle, toiletries, a small desert-camp bag and a power bank.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Can this 10-day Morocco itinerary be customized?",

      answer:
        "Yes. A private itinerary can often be adjusted to change hotel categories, add or remove stops, spend longer in Merzouga, change the Ouzoud section or adapt the route to your flight schedule.",
    },

        "Our 10-day Morocco itinerary from Marrakech was an amazing way to see so many different parts of the country. We loved exploring Marrakech, spending time in Imlil and crossing the High Atlas before visiting Ait Ben Haddou. The route through Ouarzazate, the Draa Valley and Zagora was beautiful, and the camel trek into the Merzouga desert at sunset was unforgettable. Todra Gorge, Dades Valley, Rose Valley and Ouzoud Waterfalls made the journey feel very complete.",

      "A fantastic 10-day Morocco tour from Marrakech from start to finish. The itinerary had a great balance of cities, mountains, villages, desert and nature. We especially enjoyed Imlil, Ait Ben Haddou, the Draa Valley and the road to Merzouga. Riding camels across Erg Chebbi, watching the Sahara sunset and sleeping in the desert camp were highlights, and finishing the trip with Todra Gorge, Dades Valley and Ouzoud Waterfalls was perfect.",

      "We highly recommend this Morocco itinerary for anyone who wants to see more than just Marrakech and the Sahara. Every day felt different, from the High Atlas Mountains and Imlil to Ait Ben Haddou, Zagora, Merzouga, Tinghir and the beautiful valleys in the south. The desert camp in Erg Chebbi was very special, and we also loved the walk through Todra Gorge and the visit to Ouzoud Waterfalls before returning to Marrakech.",

We enjoyed Marrakech, the mountain atmosphere in Imlil, the historic ksar of Ait Ben Haddou and the long drive through the Draa Valley toward Zagora and Merzouga.

                    <strong>Morocco itinerary 10 days from Marrakech</strong>{" "}
                    is designed for travelers who want more than a quick Sahara
                    trip. The route combines an imperial city, High Atlas
                    mountain scenery, historic kasbahs, the Draa Valley,
                    Merzouga and Erg Chebbi, dramatic gorges, Rose Valley and
                    Ouzoud Waterfalls in one private road journey.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Ten days gives you enough time to see several very
                    different parts of Morocco while still sleeping in key
                    destinations instead of returning to Marrakech every day.
                    The itinerary works especially well for first-time visitors
                    who want culture, mountains, Sahara experiences and nature
                    in the same trip.
